# Exploring World Happiness Trends Through Data Science

### Project Overview
This project leverages data science techniques to analyze the World Happiness Index, offering insights into global well-being trends from 2005 to 2023. By exploring correlations among economic, social, and health factors, we provide a deeper understanding of what drives happiness worldwide. Using machine learning, the project also predicts happiness scores, aiding policymakers and researchers in enhancing well-being strategies.

### Key Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in global happiness across 165 countries.
- Develop a predictive model to estimate happiness scores based on key variables like GDP, health, and social support.
- Analyze correlations between happiness scores and influencing factors such as freedom of choice and perceptions of corruption.
- Create actionable insights for improving global well-being metrics.

### Repository Contents
**1. Happiness_Analysis_Report [(PDF)][PDF1]:** A detailed analysis report covering methodology, findings, and conclusions.

**2. Happiness_Dataset [(Excel)][CSV]:** The cleaned and processed dataset used for analysis.

**3. EDA_and_Cleaning [(Jupyter Notebook)][ipynb]:** A Jupyter notebook documenting the data cleaning, EDA, and machine learning models.

**4. Project_Summary [(PDF)][PDF2]:** A presentation summarizing the key objectives, methods, and results.

### Methodology
**1. Data Collection and Cleaning**
    - Sourced data from the [World Happiness Report (2005â€“2023)][Data].
    - Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing values with country-specific means, and ensuring consistency.
  
**2. Analysis and Modeling**
    - Conducted EDA to explore trends, correlations, and the impact of factors like GDP, social support, and corruption.
    - Built regression models (Simple Linear and Random Forest) to predict happiness scores, with Random Forest achieving an R-squared value of 0.878.

**3. Tools and Techniques**
    - Used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) for analysis, visualization, and modeling.

### Features
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Insights into the interplay of economic, social, and health factors.
- **Scenario Insights:** Explored patterns and relationships such as the inverse correlation between happiness and corruption.
- **Machine Learning Predictions:** Forecasted happiness scores based on current metrics, providing actionable insights for policy and decision-making.
- **Visualizations:** Interactive and static plots highlighting key trends and findings.

### Team Contributions
The project was collaboratively undertaken by a team with diverse skill sets, combining technical expertise and research acumen to analyze global happiness comprehensively.

### Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data-driven insights in understanding global happiness trends. The findings emphasize the role of socio-economic and health factors in shaping well-being, offering valuable input for policymakers and researchers. The included machine learning models and visualizations make the project a dynamic tool for further exploration and strategy development.
